## Status - Not Yet Working

See [issues](https://github.com/markfirmware/ultibodockerx64/issues)

* [x] build image with stock fpc 3.0.0
* [x] download and prepare ultibo fpc and core
* [ ] compile ultibo fpc as x86-64, hopefully will not need to be built as x86
* [ ] compile ultibo rtl
* [ ] compile ultibo packages

## Road Map

* docker image for arm (e.g. raspbian)

That is all
